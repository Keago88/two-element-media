          This website describes Two Element Media. Sending a form is a request
          for a conversation, not a contract. Project fees, timelines, and
          usage rights are agreed in writing after a brief.

          Sample case studies on the homepage are labelled as samples. They
          illustrate how we talk about work; they are not client testimonials
          until replaced with named, approved stories.

          All original marks on this site — including the twin outlined
          triangles and the TWO ELEMENT wordmark — belong to Two Element Media.
          Do not copy the mark for another business.

          The site is provided as-is. South African law applies. For a live
